# Hi there, I'm Yannis Derventzis! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ I'm a 20-year-old student studying Computer Science & Telecommunications at the University of Thessaly, Greece. Passionate about technology and programming, I'm always eager to learn and explore new concepts.

ðŸ’» With a focus on software development, I've been actively learning various programming languages and refining my skills over the past two years.

ðŸŽ¸ When I'm not coding, you can find me strumming my guitar or immersing myself in a good book, all while rocking out to some tunes.

ðŸŒŸ I'm on a journey of continuous growth, aiming to contribute positively to the tech community and beyond.

ðŸš€ Let's connect and embark on this exciting tech journey together!
